         <p>
            Hello,<br> This is Berfin. It's my 3<sup>rd</sup> year in Canada. I'm studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at <em>Algonquin college</em>. <br>I've always been on a journey of self-discovery, and along the way, I've found myself jumping from one hobby to another, constantly changing my mind, eager to try something new, but never quite feeling satisfied. That’s how I started learning learning web development and realized I actually really like it. 
         </p>
         <p>
            This is where I started looking for a program that would provide a space to explore my artistic abilities further and grow, while also developing the many other skills I haven’t fully mastered yet. A place where I could make the most of what I’ve accomplished so far, whether it’s illustrating, drawing, sewing, crafting, web design, or photography <em>which I have never considered learning.</em> 
         </p>
         <p>
            However, I've struggled to find a clear purpose in life. Whenever I felt like I was falling behind, I started something new, and each of those experiences taught me something valuable. So to sum up, I'd like to add a quote I have come up with, for times I feel uninspired, <q>It's through the experience that true growth unfolds.</q>
